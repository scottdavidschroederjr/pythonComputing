# pythonComputing
My Python projects for freeCodeCamp's [Scientific Computing with Python course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/scientific-computing-with-python/).

FCC's description of the course:


Python is one of the most popular, flexible programming languages today. You can use it for everything from basic scripting to machine learning.

In the Scientific Computing with Python Certification, you'll learn Python fundamentals like variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. Then you'll quickly ramp up to complex data structures, networking, relational databases, and data visualization.
